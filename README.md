## What is PhysicsNeMo Curator?

PhysicsNeMo Curator is a sub-module of PhysicsNeMo framework, a pythonic library
designed to streamline and accelerate the crucial process of data curation at
scale for engineering and scientific datasets for training and inference.
It accelerates data curation by leveraging GPUs.

This includes customizable interfaces and pipelines for extracting, transforming
and loading data in supported formats and schema.
Please refer to the [DoMINO ETL example](./physicsnemo_curator/examples/external_aerodynamics/domino/README.md)
that illustrates the concept.

This package is intended to be used as part of the PhysicsNeMo [framework](https://github.com/NVIDIA/physicsnemo/blob/main/README.md).

## Installation and Usage

There are several ways to install PhysicsNeMo-Curator in an isolated environment:

Requirements:

- Python 3.10 or higher
- pip
- venv or conda (for environment management)

Currently only `linux/amd64` platform is supported.

### Virtual Environment (Recommended)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/physicsnemo-curator.git
cd physicsnemo-curator

# Create a virtual environment
# Use python3 to automatically select the latest available Python 3.x version
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Linux/Mac:
source venv/bin/activate

# Verify Python version
python --version  # Should be 3.10 or higher

# Install the package in editable mode with development dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Install pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install
```

### Conda Environment

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/physicsnemo-curator.git
cd physicsnemo-curator

# Create a conda environment
conda create -n physicsnemo python=3.10
conda activate physicsnemo

# Install the package in editable mode with development dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Install pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install
```

### Container

The recommended PhysicsNeMo docker image can be pulled from the
[NVIDIA Container Registry](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/teams/physicsnemo/containers/physicsnemo):

```bash
docker pull nvcr.io/nvidia/physicsnemo/physicsnemo:25.06

git clone git@github.com:NVIDIA/physicsnemo-curator.git && cd physicsnemo-curator

pip install --upgrade pip
pip install .
```

## Getting Started

### New to PhysicsNeMo-Curator?

If you're new to the framework, start with our comprehensive [**Tutorial**](./TUTORIAL.md).
It walks you through building a complete ETL pipeline from scratch. You'll learn how to:

- Define data schemas
- Implement schema validation, data sources, transformations, and sinks
- Convert HDF5 data to ML-optimized Zarr format
- Configure and run parallel processing pipelines

### Domain-Specific Examples

For domain-specific use cases, we provide ready-to-use pipelines:

**External Aerodynamics (DoMINO)**: Use the built-in ETL pipeline for training DoMINO models for automotive aerodynamics.
Please refer to the [DoMINO training recipe](https://github.com/NVIDIA/physicsnemo/tree/main/examples/cfd/external_aerodynamics/domino)
first.

```bash
physicsnemo-curator-etl --config-name domino_etl
```

Configuration is handled through Hydra. Key parameters can be set in
`config/domino_etl.yaml` or overridden via command line:

```bash
physicsnemo-curator-etl --config-name domino_etl etl.processing.num_processes=4
```

For a complete reference about supported data formats, output structures, and field variables,
see the [DoMINO Data Processing Reference](./physicsnemo_curator/examples/external_aerodynamics/domino/DoMINO_Data_Processing_Reference.md).

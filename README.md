## What is PhysicsNeMo Curator?

PhysicsNeMo Curator is a sub-module of PhysicsNeMo framework, a pythonic library
designed to streamline and accelerate the crucial process of data curation at
scale for engineering and scientific datasets for training and inference.
It accelerates data curation by leveraging GPUs.

This includes customizable interfaces and pipelines for extracting, transforming
and loading data in supported formats and schema.
Please refer to the [DoMINO ETL example](examples/external_aerodynamics/domino/README.md)
that illustrates the concept.

This package is intended to be used as part of the PhysicsNeMo [framework](https://github.com/NVIDIA/physicsnemo/blob/main/README.md).

## Installation and Usage

The recommended way of using `PhysicsNeMo-Curator` is to leverage the `PhysicsNeMo` docker image.
This can be pulled from the
[NVIDIA Container Registry](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/teams/physicsnemo/containers/physicsnemo).

Current limitations:

- Currently only `linux/amd64` platform is supported
- Currently we don't provide a PyPi wheel, and support installing from source

### PhysicsNeMo Container (Recommended)

The instructions to get started with `PhysicsNeMo-Curator` within the `PhysicsNeMo` docker container are shown below.

```bash
docker pull nvcr.io/nvidia/physicsnemo/physicsnemo:25.06

# Install from source
git clone git@github.com:NVIDIA/physicsnemo-curator.git && cd physicsnemo-curator

pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Install pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install
```

## Getting Started

### New to PhysicsNeMo-Curator?

If you're new to the framework, start with our comprehensive [**Tutorial**](./examples/tutorials/etl_hdf5_to_zarr/hdf5_to_zarr.ipynb).
It walks you through building a complete ETL pipeline from scratch. You'll learn how to:

- Define data schemas
- Implement schema validation, data sources, transformations, and sinks
- Convert HDF5 data to ML-optimized Zarr format
- Configure and run parallel processing pipelines

### Working with Your CFD Data

Have CFD simulation data from a solver like Fluent?
PhysicsNeMo-Curator can process your data through the following approaches:

#### Option 1: Convert to Supported Formats (Recommended)

**Currently Supported Formats:**

- **VTK formats**: VTU (volume mesh data), VTP (surface mesh data)
- **STL**: Geometry files

**Next Steps:**

1. Organize your converted data according to one of the [supported dataset formats](examples/external_aerodynamics/domino/DoMINO_Data_Processing_Reference.md#input-data-structure)
2. Use the built-in [DoMINO pipeline](examples/external_aerodynamics/domino/README.md)
to convert your data to an AI model training ready format
3. Train your DoMINO Model on your own data by following the [example in PhysicsNeMo](https://github.com/NVIDIA/physicsnemo/tree/main/examples/cfd/external_aerodynamics/domino)!

#### Option 2: Extend the Framework for Custom Formats

If your data is in a format not directly supported (VTU/VTP/STL), you can extend the framework.
The [Tutorial](./TUTORIAL.md) demonstrates creating a complete pipeline that reads in HDF5 data and converts it to Zarr data.

#### Getting Help

- **Domain-Specific Examples**: Check if your use case matches our [automotive aerodynamics pipeline](./physicsnemo_curator/examples/external_aerodynamics/domino/README.md).
This provides an example ETL pipeline for training DoMINO models for automotive aerodynamics applications.
For more questions about the formats, please refer to [Data Processing Reference](./physicsnemo_curator/examples/external_aerodynamics/domino/DoMINO_Data_Processing_Reference.md)
- **Architecture Questions**: See the [Tutorial](./TUTORIAL.md) for framework concepts, and to understand how to extend the pipeline
- **Anything else**: Please open a GitHub issue and we'll engage with you to answer the questions!

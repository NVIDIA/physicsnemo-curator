Checkpointing a Pipeline
=========================

This example demonstrates how to checkpoint pipeline execution using
:class:`~physicsnemo_curator.core.checkpoint.CheckpointedPipeline`.

``CheckpointedPipeline`` wraps a pipeline and records completed indices
in a SQLite database.  If the pipeline is interrupted and restarted,
already-completed indices are skipped and their cached output paths are
returned immediately.

This is especially useful for long-running pipelines over large
datasets where you want crash resilience without re-processing.

.. note::

   Install the mesh extras before running::

       pip install physicsnemo-curator[mesh]

# %%
# Imports
# -------

from physicsnemo_curator.core.checkpoint import CheckpointedPipeline

from physicsnemo_curator.mesh.filters.precision import PrecisionFilter
from physicsnemo_curator.mesh.sinks.mesh_writer import MeshSink
from physicsnemo_curator.mesh.sources.ns_cylinder import NavierStokesCylinderSource
from physicsnemo_curator.run import run_pipeline

# %%
# Build and Wrap the Pipeline
# ----------------------------
#
# First build a normal pipeline, then wrap it with
# :class:`~physicsnemo_curator.core.checkpoint.CheckpointedPipeline`.
# The ``db_path`` argument specifies where the SQLite checkpoint file
# is stored.

pipeline = (
    NavierStokesCylinderSource()
    .filter(PrecisionFilter(target_dtype="float32"))
    .write(MeshSink(output_dir="outputs/checkpoint/meshes/"))
)

checkpointed = CheckpointedPipeline(
    pipeline,
    db_path="outputs/checkpoint/pipeline.db",
)

# %%
# First Run — Process 5 Indices
# ------------------------------
#
# On the first run, all indices are new and will be fully executed.

results = run_pipeline(
    checkpointed,
    n_jobs=1,
    backend="sequential",
    indices=range(5),
    progress=True,
)

print(f"First run processed {len(results)} indices")
print(f"Checkpoint summary: {checkpointed.summary()}")

# %%
# Second Run — Resume from Checkpoint
# ------------------------------------
#
# If we run the same pipeline again (even with overlapping indices),
# completed indices are skipped.  Their cached output paths are returned
# from the database without re-executing the pipeline.

results_resumed = run_pipeline(
    checkpointed,
    n_jobs=1,
    backend="sequential",
    indices=range(8),  # 0-4 cached, 5-7 new
    progress=True,
)

print(f"\nSecond run returned {len(results_resumed)} results")
print(f"Checkpoint summary: {checkpointed.summary()}")

# %%
# Query Checkpoint State
# ----------------------
#
# The checkpoint database tracks which indices have been completed,
# which failed, and which remain.

print(f"\nCompleted indices: {checkpointed.completed_indices}")
print(f"Remaining (of 500): {len(checkpointed.remaining_indices)}")
print(f"Config hash: {checkpointed.config_hash[:16]}...")
print(f"Database: {checkpointed.db_path}")

# %%
# Composing with ProfiledPipeline
# --------------------------------
#
# ``CheckpointedPipeline`` composes with
# :class:`~physicsnemo_curator.core.profiling.ProfiledPipeline` — you
# can profile *and* checkpoint at the same time:
#
# .. code-block:: python
#
#     from physicsnemo_curator.core.profiling import ProfiledPipeline
#
#     profiled = ProfiledPipeline(pipeline)
#     checkpointed = CheckpointedPipeline(profiled, db_path="ckpt.db")
#     run_pipeline(checkpointed, n_jobs=4)
#
# The checkpoint wraps the profiled pipeline, so skipped indices bypass
# both profiling and execution.

# %%
# Reset Checkpoint
# ----------------
#
# To re-process all indices from scratch, call ``reset()``:

checkpointed.reset()
print(f"\nAfter reset: {checkpointed.summary()}")
